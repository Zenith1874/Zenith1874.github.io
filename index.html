                <p>
                    I am a Master's student in Computer Science at New Mexico State University with a solid foundation in software engineering and financial management. With over five years of experience in product management and business analysis, I have specialized in developing financial data systems and enterprise solutions that drive strategic decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My academic focus centers on real-time data analysis, database optimization, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Recent projects include stock price prediction, bioinformatics sequence assembly, and the development of a performance monitoring tool, all designed to deliver data-driven insights and improve user experiences.
                <p>
                    Looking forward, I aim to leverage my technical expertise, industry background, and research interests to advance innovations in financial software, enterprise systems, and decision support frameworks. My goal is to contribute to the intersection of technology and business, enabling organizations to make smarter, data-informed decisions.
